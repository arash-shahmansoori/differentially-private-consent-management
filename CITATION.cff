  This code-base supports differential privacy for speaker
  recognition in voice assistant systems using the private
  data and a small portion of publicly available data. In
  particular, it addresses the differential privacy (DP) for
  speaker recognition in voice assistant systems using the
  private data and a small portion of publicly available
  data for a composite bucket of speakers. A composite
  bucket is comprised of a bucket or buckets of speakers.
